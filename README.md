# math_tools

This package contains the mathematical functions related to the Lie algebra and the Chebyshev differentiation.
Specifically, it implements all the transformation and operation on the SO(3) and SE(3) groups.
It also contains everything related to the Chebyshev points such as the grid and the differentiation matrix.
It provides a generic library that allows to integrate linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equations.
